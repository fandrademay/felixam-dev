# Communications Offences
- Used to be mostly in the Communications Act 2003
	- Now mostly in the **Online Safety Act 2023**
		- not much case law, but a lot of older case law
- Communications Act 2003, S 125
	- Dishonestly obtaining electronic communications services
		- "(a) dishonestly obtains an electronic communications service and"
		- "(b) does so with the intent to avoid payment of a charge applicable to the provision of that service"
		- *R v Straszkiewicz (unreported) includes "wardriving"*
			- remnant subculture of '90s hacking culture
			- driving around in a car with a wifi antenna looking for unprotected networks, normally non-malicious
		- Meant to address stealing internet connection
			- can also imply stealing access to Netflix (accessing the service without paying)
				- does password sharing count as this?
- ## Malicious Communications
	- ### Malicious Communications Act 1988
		- S1 (1)(a)(i) Sends an electronic communication letter or article of any kind which conveys a message that is grossly offensive
		- (b) sends any article of electronic communication which is wholly or in part indecent or grossly offensive
		- Is guilty of an offence should they cause distress or anxiety to the recipient or to any other person to whom he intends that it or its contents or nature should be communicated
	- *R. v Casserly (Thomas)[2024] 1 W.L.R. 2760*
		- old man with poor eyesight asked how he could be effective in politics
		- communication must be intended to cause distress
			- the comms were not offensive
		- jury must be directed to consider the whole context of the comms
			- includes the idea of politics
	- *Connolly v DPP [2008] 1 W.L.R. 276*
		- sent pics of aborted foetus to pharmacists who ran pharmacies who sold abortion pills
		- grossly offensive and indecent have ordinary meanings, no tribunal in this case it would be wrong to say that no reasonable tribunal would have found them so
			- question for the jury
		- political protest is not a defence
			- matters to context, but it isn't a defence
		- no violation of human rights, her right to protest does not mean she has free reign to cause distress to others, and her religious view did not grant special protect to her expression.
	- *Meechan v Procurator Fiscal, Airdrie [2019] HCJAC 13*
		- Count Dankula (2016-edgy-ass-dickhead)
		- Under S127 of communications act 2003 relating to grossly offensive messages, find Â£800 for making a video where he got his GF dog to nazi salute to the phrase "do you want to gas the jews?"
		- Comedy was not a defence either
- ## False Communications Offences
	- ### S 179 Online Safety Act 2023
		- (1) A person commits an offence if -
			- (a) the person sends a message
			- (b) the message conveys information that the person knows to be false
			- (c) at the time of sending it, the person intended the message, or the information in it, to cause non-trivial psychological or physical harm
		- (2) For the purposes of this offence an individual is a "likely audience"
			- would encounter the message
			- in the online context would encounter a subsequent message forwarding or sharing the content of the message
		- broad range of exceptions such as distributors
			- like news publishers, cinemas etc.
- ## Threatening Communications
	- ### S181 OSA 2023
		- replaces S1 1 a ii of the Malicious Communications Act
		- (1)(a) The person sends a message
		- (b) the message conveys a threat of death or serious harm and
		- (c) at the time of sending it, the person -
			- (i) it intended a viewer would fear that the threat would be carried out
			- (ii)was reckless as to whether a viewer might think the threat would be carried out
		- (2) includes Rape, GBH, assault by penetration, and serious financial loss
			- for fin-loss, it is a defence to show that the threat was a reasonable means to enforce a lawful demand
- ## Sending a Message
	- both S 179 and S 181 rely on the phrase
	- S 182 defines this as sending transmitting or publishing a comm including oral comms by electronic means, or sending or giving to an individual a letter or a thing of any other description, also includes causing such a communication or thing to be sent or given to the individual
		- includes hyperlinks
			- so linking to a harmful message, instead of sending the text of the message itself
	- (4) this excludes services by which comms is sent
		- if i send a message, twitter is not personally liable for the comm
	- (6) does not matter who made the comm
		- so you can share somebody else's offensive message and be charged
- ## Sending Flashing Images
	- S 183 OSA 2023 (it's new, wow!)
	- Special offence for sending flashing images which may trigger seizures if either
	- sent reasonably foreseeable that somebody with epilepsy may be a recipient AND the sender intended that somebody with epilepsy would suffer harm as a result
	- the sender believes that somebody who has, or might have, will or may view the message and they intend that this person will suffer harm
		- oriented to cover widely available posts rather than direct messages
	- also an offence to show flashing images to somebody with the intent
	- same exceptions about distributors apply here too
- ## Encouraging or Assisting Serious Self Harm
	- S 184 OSA 2023 (it's new, wow!)
	- Relevant act capable of encouraging or assisting serious self harm
		- communicating in person
		- sending e-comm
		- showing such comms
		- publishing material
		- sending, showing or giving someone such a comm
	- with the intent that it encourage or assist serious self har,
		- equivalent to GBH
- ## Sexual Offences
	- Online Safety Act 2023, inserts two offences into the Sexual Offences Act 2003 (S 187 and 188 insert S66A and 66B respectively)
	- 66A SOA 2003 
		- sending etc. photograph or film of genitals
		- sending or giving a photo or film on any persons genitals that will cause harm, distress, or humiliation
		- or sending/giving the photo or film to obtain sexual gratification and are reckless as to causing alarm, distress, or humiliation
	- ### Sharing or threatening to share intimate photo or film
		- ==*sorry she went through this bit too fast for me to make notes on what each section means properly*==
		- subsection 2,3,4 all have max sentences of 2 years
			- these sections have intent to cause alarm distress or humiliation
		- (7) in the case of threats, images can be fake or destroyed at time of prosecution and prosecution does not need to prove the image actually existed
		- (8) it is a defence to show that they had a reasonable excuse for sharing the image
		- 66D (5) is a long list of what "intimate state" means
			- nudity, underwear, visible genitalia/breasts/buttocks through wet clothes, sex, ejaculation, defecation etc.
		- #### Exceptions
